# 1. For AR(p) models the number of observations, n, is assumed to be sufficiently
#    large to use the conditional log-likelihood instead of full likelihood.

# 2. For more advanced processes, especially dependent on graident based maximum
#    likelihood an integration with pytorch has to be made to utilize automatic
#    differentiation.
